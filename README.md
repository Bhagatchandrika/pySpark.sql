This script can be helpful for predictive analytics in several ways:

Trend Analysis: By examining daily content size and response codes over time, one can identify trends and patterns. This information can be used to predict future content size trends or anticipate potential issues based on recurring response codes.

Resource Planning: Understanding the distribution of content sizes and response codes helps in resource allocation. Predictive models can be built based on historical data to forecast resource requirements and optimize infrastructure accordingly.

Anomaly Detection: By analyzing response codes and identifying endpoints with unusually high or low content sizes, one can detect anomalies in the system. Predictive models can be trained to automatically flag such anomalies, enabling proactive intervention to prevent service disruptions or security breaches.

Capacity Planning: Predictive analytics can help in forecasting future demands on the system based on historical data. By analyzing trends in content size and response codes, one can estimate future workload requirements and plan system capacity accordingly.

Performance Optimization: Insights gained from analyzing content sizes, response codes, and IP addresses
